# SCR Train Randomizer

The SCR Train Randomizer is a Python application built with Tkinter that provides random assignments for various roles within a simulated train environment. It's designed to add an element of unpredictability and replayability to train simulation games or scenarios.

## Features

This application offers randomization for the following roles:

*   **Passenger:** Generates a random start and finish station.
*   **Driver:** Provides a random route based on the selected operator (Metro, Airlink, Express, Connect, Waterline).
*   **Dispatcher:** Selects a random station to dispatch.
*   **Guard:** Generates a random train to guard.
*   **Signaller:** Assigns a random zone to signal.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bursaraykral1881/Scr-Randomizer-.git
    cd Scr-Randomizer-
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses the `Pillow` library for image handling. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```
